The 8th Annual
AFSIC – Investing in Africa forum, scheduled for May 5th -7th
2020 in London, has
already confirmed over 300 top level speakers and panellists including a
huge range of Africa’s most important investors, dealmakers and business
leaders, who will unpack
the increasing global investment momentum into Africa’s growing public and
private sectors and highlight new growth opportunities across the continent. The AFSIC 2020 agenda is specifically investment
focused, with several of the most experienced and successful asset management
firms investing in Africa sharing insights into where smart money is investing,
and business leaders running some of Africa’s most exciting growth companies
showcasing new investment opportunities, with focussed streams in Fintech,
Financial Services, Infrastructure, Energy, Education, Agriculture and Real
Estate. With ABSA Corporate
Investment Bank, FSD Africa, CDC Group and Moodys heading up
an impressive group of supporting sponsors, the forum will be an excellent
follow up to the British Government’s UK-Africa Investment Summit which took
place this week to create sustainable UK-Africa partnerships. FSD Africa, one of AFSIC’s lead sponsors, announced a £90m
commitment from UK Aid this week to initiate a new phase of financial sector
development, part of an ambitious £320m UK Aid package to strengthen Africa’s financial
markets. Another of AFSIC’s lead sponsors and Africa’s largest
private investor CDC Group, announced this week that they would be
investing £2bn in Africa over the next two years to continue supporting
businesses in Africa across a wide range of sectors and creating lasting change
to reach the UN’s sustainable Development Goals. CDC Group will once again be
hosting the not-to-be-missed Meet African Dealmakers Event at AFSIC. With over 1500
delegates expected to attend, AFSIC 2020 offers unparalleled
opportunities to network and develop strong business relationships with
investors, financial intermediaries and African business leaders through an
array of multiple presentation and panel streams, discussions, networking
events, exhibition stands, business match-making meetings, workshops and
country-focussed sessions. Early Bird Registration expires 31st
